    <h2> Chedder Bay Biscuit Chicken</h2>
    <img src="biscuit.webp" alt="">
    <p>This chicken cobbler takes the flavors of chicken pot pie. <br>
        Instead of encasing it in pie crust it's topped with Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (10.5oz) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 package cheddar biscuit mix (such as Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish with melted butter.</li>
        <li>Place shredded chicken and vegetables into the dish; season with thyme, pepper, and salt. Pour over condensed soup, broth, and cream; stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Prepare biscuit mix according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Drop 8 (about 1/4 cup) biscuit dough portions onto chicken and vegetable mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until biscuits are golden brown on top and casserole is bubbling around the edges, about 40 minutes. Sprinkle with thyme.</li>
        </ol>
